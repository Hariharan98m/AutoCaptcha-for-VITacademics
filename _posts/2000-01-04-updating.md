## Updates are seamless

If you are installing it from the Chrome Web Store or the Firefox Add-on Marketplace, then the extension will auto-update when a new version is available. No action needed on your part.

We plan to add a bunch of new features moving forward, and love to hear your feedback and suggestions.
You can reach us via [email](mailto:karthikb351@gmail.com) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/karthikb351/AutoCaptcha-for-Chrome/issues/new)
